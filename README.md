## Concept
####  Overview:
 Human kind has long been starring at the night-sky, across any civilization you can enumerate.<br><br>
 The core idea of this theme is to implement the familiar night-sky vision so that the theme is naturally eye-friendly without distractions and cognitive overloads.<br><br>
 Implementation is also carefully done with programmer's point of view so that colors are syntactically meaningful, emphasized and easy to distinguish between one another.<br><br>
 Do you still want to keep starring at your theme just aimed at:
  - being dark
  - being colorful for the sake of being colorful
  - using author's favourite colors

 If not, this theme could be your solution.<br><br>
 **Feel free to try!**
