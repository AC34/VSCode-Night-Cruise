## Concept
####  Overview:
 Human kind has long been starring at the night-sky, across any civilization you can enumerate.<br><br>
 The core idea of this theme is to implement the familiar night-sky vision so that the theme is naturally eye-friendly without distractions and cognitive overloads.<br><br>
 Implementation is also carefully done with programmer's point of view so that colors are syntactically meaningful, emphasized and easy to distinguish between one another.<br><br>
 Do you still want to keep starring at your theme just aimed at:
  - being dark
  - being colorful for the sake of being colorful
  - using author's favourite colors

 If not, this theme could be your solution.<br><br>
 **Feel free to try!**

#### UI
   - Background
     - Deep blue. non-stimulative relaxing color.
   - Accent colors
     - Lighter blue than background. Some colors are close to purple.

#### Editor
   - Backgroud
      - Deeper than UI blue.(easy to distinguish from other UI components)
   - Comment
      - Light gray. Not too bright, yet still easy to read.
   - language based keywords
      - Light blue.  language based keywords are always predictable.
      - Orange. This alternative color intends to distinguish from the other light blue, while still managint to stay lower than the main gold.
   - User defined keywords
      - Gold. This is the core part. A-star-in-the-night-sky-like gold. Your eyes are not catching those characters, but the colors are catching your eyes. This coloring makes it easier for you to face the display through the night.
