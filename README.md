### Concept.
####  Overview:
 Human kind has long been starring at the night sky. This was part of any civilization you can enumerate.<br><br>
 The core idea of this theme is to implement the familiar night sky vision so that the theme is naturally eye-friendly without distractions and cognitive overloads.<br><br>
 Implementation is carefully done with programmer's point of view so that colors are also syntactically meaningful and easy to distinguish between one another.<br><br>
 Do you still want to keep starring at your theme just aimed at:
  - being dark
  - being colorful for the sake of being colorful
  - using author's favourite colors

 If not, this theme could be your solution.<br><br>
 Feel free to try.
